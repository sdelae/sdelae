        <p class="section-content">
            I am currently pursuing a Master's in Computer Science and Business Technology, 
            focusing on integrating technological solutions with business strategies. As I have a business background this is the perfect opportunity to blend my interest with my              experience. I am currently exploring areas such as data analytics, programming with python and Cloud (gcp).

        <h2 class="section-title">Interests</h2>
        <p class="section-content">
            <p>I enjoy cybersecurity, programming, and being able to analyze problems with a more technical mindset. In my free time you can either find me doing a Lego, a puzzle, or at the movie theater. I also enjoy helping my home country, Colombia, and I have done multiple volunteer experiences through the years. As of now I am doing a project with a foundation back home where we help make crochet animals for kids with cancer to make a sense of comfort through their therapies and medicine.

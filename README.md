        <p class="section-content">
            I am currently pursuing a Master's in Computer Science and Business Technology, 
            focusing on integrating technological solutions with business strategies. As I have a business background this is the perfect opportunity to blend my interest with my              experience. I am currently exploring areas such as data analytics, programming with python and Cloud (gcp).

            <strong>I enjoy cybersecurity, programming, and being able to analyze problems with a more technical mindset. In my free time you can either find me doing a Lego, a puzzle, or at the movie theater.
